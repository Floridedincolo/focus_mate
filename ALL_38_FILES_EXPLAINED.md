## 💡 Key Insights from All Documents

### From Quick Reference:
**There are 38 files, but they follow a clear pattern:**
- 4 layers (Domain, Data, Presentation, Core)
- Each layer has clear responsibilities
- Files within each layer follow naming conventions

### From Detailed Explanations:
**Each file solves a specific problem:**
- Entities represent domain concepts
- Repositories abstract data access
- Use cases encode business rules
- Mappers convert between formats
- Providers connect UI to business logic
- DI bootstraps everything

### From Architecture:
**Data flows through the system in layers:**
```
UI → Providers → Use Cases → Repositories → Data Sources → External
```
**Each layer is isolated and testable.**
